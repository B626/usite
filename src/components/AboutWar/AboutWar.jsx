         <h2>A counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops in the south of the country is "gathering momentum" around the occupied city of Kherson, according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Ukraine's forces have been using new long-range artillery to target bridges across the Dnipro River and the MoD said that two recent attacks on the Antonivskiy Bridge in Kherson have left Russian troops "virtually cut off".

Kherson was the first city in Ukraine to be taken by Russian forces after their invasion in February. The MoD said its loss would "severely undermine Russia's attempts to paint the occupation as a success".</h2>
